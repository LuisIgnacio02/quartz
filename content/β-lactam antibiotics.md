## Classification

[[Penicillins]]
[[Cephalosporins]]
[[Carbapenems]]
[[Monobactams]]


## Structure

They contain a β-lactam ring.

## Pharmacokinetics



## Mechanism of action

They inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial peptidoglycan wall, specially in gram-positive bacteria. They act in the last step of peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating a transpeptidase (also called a PBP) that completes the cross-linking between two polymers. They may act through lytic and nonlytic mechanisms.

They are most active against bacteria in the logarithmic phase of growth, and do not affect bacteria inside viable cells of the host.

## Contraindications and interactions



## Mechanisms of resistance

It is increasing dramatically. They can be combined with [[β-lactamase inhibitors]] to extend their utility. Resistance also includes alteration in bacterial enzymes and decreased entry of the antibiotic.

Bacteria may acquire resistance by mutations that decrease affinity of PBPs for the antibiotic; however, many different PBPs must be affected for the antibiotic to decrease its effectivity. This mutations may be acquired through homologous recombination between different bacterial species.

Resistance may result from the inability to penetrate to the site of action. in gram-positive bacteria, the antibiotic can penetrate to the outer layer of the cytoplasmic membrane because the peptidoglycan wall is near the cell surface. In gram-negative bacteria, however, the inner membrane is covered by the outer membrane, lipopolysaccharide and capsule. Some antibiotic molecules may pass through aqueous channels in the outer membrane called porins. Some bacteria may have active efflux pumps that remove the antibiotic.

Baceria can inactivate this antibotics via β-lactamases, grouped from A through D; most of these are penicillinases. The specificity of a β-lactamase can be narrow or ample. Gram-positive bacteria produce larger amounts of β-lactamase. Some enzymes are encoded in plasmids that may be transferred by bacteriophages and that are inducible by substrates. Gram-negative bacteria have less β-lactamases, located in the periplasmic space. These are encoded by chromosomes or plasmids, constitutive or inducible. Some β-lactamases are capable of hydrolyzing [[Carbapenems]] as well.

The biofilm produced by microorganisms adhering to prosthetics is composed of polysaccharides that decrease growth rate and are less sensitive to antibiotics.
