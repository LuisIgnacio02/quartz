## Antimicrobial activity

Penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) and penicillin V (phenoxymethyl) act on aerobic gram-positive organisms, but penicillin G is 5 to 10 times more active against [[Neisseria]] and other anaerobes such as [[Clostridium]]. 

#### Resistant organisms

Resistant organisms include  [[Prevotella melaninogenicus]], [[Bacterioides fragilis]] and resistant [[Viridans Streptococci]] and [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]. These last two are emerging in pediatric patients, and often are also resistant to third-generation [[Cephalosporins]].

#### Susceptible organisms

Susceptible organisms include most aerobic and anaerobic organisms, such as [[Neisseria]], [[Streptococcus]], [[Meningococcus]],  [[Clostridium]], [[Actinomyces israelii]], [[Streptobacillus moniliformis]], [[Pasteurella multocida]], [[Listeria monocytogenes]], [[Treponema pallidum]] and [[Borrelia burgdorferi]].

Moderately susceptible organisms include [[Leptospira]].
