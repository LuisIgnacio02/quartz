Four of the five high-molecular-weight PBPs of the most highly  
penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have decreased  
affinity for β-lactam antibiotics as a result of interspecies homolo-  
gous recombination events. In contrast, isolates with high-level resis-  
tance to third-generation cephalosporins contain alterations of only  
two of the five high-molecular-weight PBPs because the other PBPs  
have inherently low affinity for the third-generation cephalosporins.  
MRSA is resistant via acquisition of an additional high-molecular-  
weight PBP (via a transposon) with a very low affinity for all β-lactam  
antibiotics; this mechanism is also responsible for methicillin resistance  
in the coagulase-negative staphylococci.





The information for staphy-  
lococcal penicillinase is encoded in a plasmid; this may be transferred  
by bacteriophage to other bacteria and is inducible by substrates.
