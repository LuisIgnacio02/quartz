Elimination disorders manifest in childhood and adolescence, as well as in adulthood, and are characterized by inappropriate micturition during the day ([[Daytime urinary incontinence]]) or the night ([[Enuresis]]), or inappropriate defecation ([[Encopresis]]). The spontaneous remission rate is high in children, and appropriate treatment is effective in adulthood.
