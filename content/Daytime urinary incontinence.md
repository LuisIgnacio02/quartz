Daytime urinary incontinence is any intentional or involuntary leakage of urine during wake time, which is intermittent and mostly due to functional problems.

## Epidemiology

It affects 3% of 7 years old, and prevalence decreases with age (less than 1% in adolescents); it is common among women, obese people and the elderly (50% of women and 25% of men older than 65 years old). The most prevalent subtypes in children are urge incontinence and voiding postponement. Stress incontinence is common in adults. The comorbidity of psychological symptoms and disorders is higher, compared to children with enuresis.

Female patients, specially pregnant women, women who experienced childbirth, and women active in sports, suffer more from stress and mixed incontinence, while males suffer from urge incontinence.

## Etiology

Psychosocial factors, such as stressors (moving from house, sexual abuse, conflicts in the family), and genetic factors play a major role. It can also be caused due to barriers to toileting. It is associated with [[Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], [[Oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[Conduct disorders]].

Risk factors include [[Obesity]], hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, parity, [[Pneumology |pulmonary diseases]], [[Diabetes]], [[Dementia]] and advanced age.

Common conditions associated with incontinence are neurological causes ([[Multiple sclerosis]], spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, [[Dementia]] and delirium) and genitourinary causes (pelvic floor trauma like surgery, childbirth, fracture, heavy labor, sphincter deficiency, urethral hypermobility, obstruction, pelvic floor weakness, fistula and impaired detrusor contractility). Transient causes include drugs, infections, [[Postmenopausal atrophic urethritis]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatric causes]] (depression, delirium), excessive urinary output (hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia), impaction and impaired mobility.

## Pathophysiology

Urge incontinence (bladder dysfunction) is preceded by a sense of urinary urgency due to detrusor overactivity during the filling phase, poor compliance of the detrusor or bladder hypersensitivity. Detrusor overactivity may be caused by bladder irritation (loss of microbiome, abnormalities) or loss of neurologic control (S2-S4 spinal cord injuries, [[Multiple sclerosis]], [[Diabetes]], above brainstem injuries, [[Stroke]], [[Parkinson disease]]). Poor detrusor compliance results in failure of the bladder to stretch, and may be caused by catheterization and pelvic radiotherapy. Inflammation of the urothelium and infection (cancer, renal stones) can lead to alteration of sensation and bladder hypersensitivity. It is also called overactive bladder syndrome, but this last one may not have incontinence.

Voiding postponement can be due to an acquired habit of [[Oppositional defiant disorder]] patients.

Neurogenic bladder can manifest as detrusor overactivity (spastic) and detrusor underactivity (flaccid). Spastic neurogenic bladder can manifest as detrusor sphincter dyssynergia or dysfunctional voiding, where the detrusor contracts and the urethral sphincter is activated instead of relaxed in the emptying phase, blocking most of the urine outlet.

Stress incontinence (urethral dysfunction) occurs with increases in intraabdominal pressure, like exertion, effort, sneezing, laughing or coughing due urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Urethral hypermobility (inability to close) is caused by pelvic floor weakness (postmenopausal estrogen loss, [[Rheumathology |connective tissue disorders]], childbirth that damages levator ani or S2-S4 nerve roots) or loss of the normal urethrovesical angle. Sphincter deficiency causes sphincter weakness due to aging, [[Obesity]], neurologic dysfunction, pelvic trauma or prostate surgery. 

Overflow urinary incontinence includes detrusor underactivity and bladder obstruction. Underactivity of the detrusor can be caused by [[Cholinergic antagonists]], S2-S4 spinal cord injuries, [[Multiple sclerosis]] and [[Diabetes |diabetic neuropathy]]. Bladder obstruction can be caused by [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. These mechanisms lead to incomplete bladder emptying and bladder overfilling, distending the bladder and increasing its pressure, causing dribbling when the intravesical pressure increases.

Total incontinence results from complete loss of sphincter function due to surgery, nerve damage, malignancies o abnormal anatomy (fistulas).

## Diagnosis

#### Assessment 

1. International Children's Continence Society criteria
	- [ ] Recurrent intermittent urination into bed or clothes, intentional or not, during the wake state
	- [ ] At least once per month for at least three months
	- [ ] At least 5 years developmentally
	- [ ] Not due to use of a substance or other organic condition (see [[#Differential diagnosis]])
	Specify if wetting is frequent (more than 4 times a week) or infrequent.
	Specify the subtype.
2. Screen for red flags
	1. Pain
	2. Hematuria or proteinuria
	3. Obstruction
	4. Fistula
	5. Prolapse
	6. Urinary tract infections
3. Office-based examinations
	1. Cough stress test
		- For stress incontinence
		- In standing position, ask to cough and note if there is immediate leakage of urine
		- The bladder must feel full before performing this test
		- If the leakage is delayed more than 5 seconds, it indicates urge incontinence
		- If the leakage is immediate, it indicates stress incontinence
	2. Cotton swab test
		- For urethral hypermobility (stress incontinence)
		- After insertion of a swab into the bladder through the urethra (at an angle greater than 30), ask to Valsalva
	3. Marshall test
		- For stress incontinence
		- Only for women
		- Ask to cough and when urine is released, elevate the urethra with a clamp or insert the fingers into the vagina; there should not be urine released on renewed coughing
	4. Pad test
		- For urge incontinence
		- Ask to wear a weighed pad, perform activities and drink liquids, and then weigh again the pad.
4. Questionnaires
	1. International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire
	2. Revised urinary incontinence scale
	3. 3IQ questionnaire
		- To differentiate between stress, urge and mixed incontinence
5. Urinalysis
	- Detects urinary tract infections, enlarged prostate, prolapse or malignancies
6. Ultrasonography
	- For overflow incontinence
	- Measures postvoid residual volume and bladder wall thickness
	- Detects malformations and obstruction (hydronephrosis)
	- Only perform if suspected renal pathology or impairment due to urinary retention and vesicoureteral reflux
7. Uroflowmetry
	- For dysfunctional voiding
8. Blood urea nitrogen test and creatinine
	- For overflow incontinence
	- Detects obstructions

#### Advanced studies

1. Micturating cystourethrogram
	- For vesicoureteral reflux and abnormalities
2. Urodynamic studies
	- To determine detrusor and sphincter function
3. Cystoscopy
	- For tumors and fistulae
4. Ultrasound pelvis
	- For pelvic floor dysfunction
5. Magnetic resonance
	1. Defecography

	2. Abdomen and pelvis
		- For urinary tract strictures and tumors
	3. Spine
		- For spinal disorders
6. Computarized tomography with contrast
	- For abnormalities (thickening, masses)

#### Differential diagnosis

Conditions such as [[Epispadias]], [[Hypospadias]], [[Urethral stenosis]], [[Spina bifida]], [[Tethered cord syndrome]], renal or ureteral calculi, pelvic or intraabdominal masses, and urinary tract infections can cause daytime urinary incontinence or [[Enuresis]] as a symptom (less than one wetting per month). These have to be ruled out before diagnosing daytime incontinence or enuresis.

Malformations such as ectopic ureter, loss of sphincter function, or vesiculogenital fistula can cause continuous (total) urinary incontinence (during day and night). These have to be ruled out before diagnosing daytime incontinence or [[Enuresis]].

Other differential diagnosis include delirium, substance use (diuretics, alcohol, caffeine), psychological disorders, excessive urine output ([[Diabetes]]), and stool impaction.

Diurnal urinary frequency of childhood is a benign, self-limited condition characterized by frequency and urgency, without incontinence, and should not be confused.

## Special situations

#### Elderly

It is more common to encounter functional incontinence due to cognitive or mobility impairment. There is also comorbidity and polypharmacy. 

Consider cognitive and functional testing. Limit measuring of postvoid volume if diabetes, recurrent urinary infections, urinary retention, obstruction, detrusor underactivity, constipation, medications that delay emptying, and no improvement after treatment of urge incontinence.

Use of antimuscarinics in the elderly can lead to worsening of dementia. Consider prompted voiding.

#### Pregnancy

It is more common to encounter stress incontinence, specially in the late pregnancy. Vaginal delivery is associated with higher rates of incontinence.

## Prognosis

Follow-up with M-ISI questionnaire, ICIQ-UI questionnaire, and Sandvik questionnaire.

Complications include [[Depression]], distress, [[Dermatitis]], skin infections, sores, decreased independence and motivation, and urinary tract infections
