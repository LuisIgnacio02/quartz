## Classification

Penicillins are classified according to their spectra of activity:
[[Penicillin G and penicillin V]]
[[Penicillinase-resistant penicillins]]
[[Aminopenicillins]]
[[Antipseudomonal penicillins]]

## Structure

They consist of a thiazolidine ring connected to a β-lactam ring, as well as a side chain. The nucleus itself is the structural requirement for biological activity. Side chains added can alter the susceptibility of the molecule to inactivating enzymes or change the pharmacological properties and antibacterial activity.

## Common properties

Following oral administration, they are distributed mostly in joint fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid and bile. They do not penetrate well prostatic secretions, brain tissue and intraocular fluid. In the CSF, they concentrate at 1% of concentration in plasma, and with meningitis they achieve 5% concentration in plasma. 

They are eliminated through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, with a half-life of 30 to 90 minutes.
