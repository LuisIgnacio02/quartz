They act in the last step of peptidoglycan synthesis by acylating a transpeptidase (also called a PBP) that completes the cross-linking between two polymers. They may act through lytic and nonlytic mechanisms.\n\nThey are most active against bacteria in the logarithmic phase of growth, and do not affect bacteria inside viable cells of the host.\n\n## Adverse effects\n\n\n\n## Contraindications and interactions\n\n\n\n## Mechanisms of resistance\n\nIt is increasing dramatically. They can be combined with [[β-lactamase inhibitors]] to extend their utility. Resistance also includes alteration in bacterial enzymes and decreased entry of the antibiotic.\n\nBacteria may acquire resistance by mutations that decrease affinity of PBPs for the antibiotic; however, many different PBPs must be affected for the antibiotic to decrease its effectivity. This mutations may be acquired through homologous recombination between different bacterial species.\n\nResistance may result from the inability to penetrate to the site of action. in gram-positive bacteria, the antibiotic can penetrate to the outer layer of the cytoplasmic membrane because the peptidoglycan wall is near the cell surface. In gram-negative bacteria, however, the inner membrane is covered by the outer membrane, lipopolysaccharide and capsule. Some antibiotic molecules may pass through aqueous channels in the outer membrane called porins. Some bacteria may have active efflux pumps that remove the antibiotic.\n\nBaceria can inactivate this antibotics via β-lactamases, grouped from A through D; most of these are penicillinases. The specificity of a β-lactamase can be narrow or ample. Gram-positive bacteria produce larger amounts of β-lactamase. Some enzymes are encoded in plasmids that may be transferred by bacteriophages and that are inducible by substrates. Gram-negative bacteria have less β-lactamases, located in the periplasmic space. These are encoded by chromosomes or plasmids, constitutive or inducible. Some β-lactamases are capable of hydrolyzing [[Carbapenems]] as well.\n\nThe biofilm produced by microorganisms adhering to prosthetics is composed of polysaccharides that decrease growth rate and are less sensitive to antibiotics.\n\n## Administration\n\n\n\n## Therapeutic indications\n\n\n\n## Sources\n\nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.374095956Z","tags":null},"/%CE%B23-adrenergic-agonists":{"title":"","content":"#Autonomic-modulators #β-agonists\n\n## Mechanism of action\n\nThese drugs cause direct relaxation of the detrusor muscle, inhibiting spontaneous contractile activity in the bladder and reducing in its afferent activity.\n\n## Adverse effects\n\n- Hypertension\n- Headache\n\n## Examples\n\n[[Mirabegron]]\n\n## Sources\n\nAmboss","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.374095956Z","tags":null},"/100-Conditions-Index":{"title":"","content":"[[Psychiatry]]\n\n[[Pediatrics]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/200-Pharmacy-index":{"title":"","content":"[[Analgesics]]\n\n[[Antibiotics]]\n\n\t[[Cell wall inhibitors]]\n\t  \n\t\t[[β-lactam antibiotics]]\n\t\t  \n\t\t\t[[Penicillins]]\n\t\t\t  \n[[Antivirals]]\n\n[[Antimycobacterials]]\n\n[[Antiparasitics]]\n\n[[Antifungals]]\n\n[[Anticoagulants]]\n\n[[Antidepressants]]\n\n\t[[Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]]\n\t  \n\t[[Tricyclic antidepressants]]\n\t  \n[[Antineoplastics]]\n\n[[Autonomic modulators]]\n\n\t[[Cholinergic antagonists]]\n\t  \n\t\t[[Muscarinic antagonists]]\n\t\t  \n\t[[Cholinergic agonists]]\n\t  \n\t\t[[Muscarinic agonists]]\n\t\t  \n\t[[α-adrenergic antagonists]]\n\t  \n\t\t[[α1-adrenergic antagonists]]\n\t\t  \n\t[[β-adrenergic agonists]]\n\t  \n\t\t[[β3-adrenergic agonists]]\n\t\t  \n[[Steroids]]\n\n[[Diuretics]]\n\n[[Antidiuretics]]\n\n[[Proton-pump inhibitors]]\n\n[[Incretins]]\n\n[[Immunomodulators]]\n\n[[Statins]]\n\n[[Antithrombotics]]\n\n[[Decongestants]]\n\n[[Antidiabetics]]\n\n[[Antihypertensives]]\n\n[[Smooth muscle modulators]]\n\n[[Anesthetics]]\n\n[[Antipsychotics]]\n\n[[Drugs of abuse]]\n\n[[Antirheumatics]]\n\n[[Hormone regulators]]\n\n[[Antiarrhytmics]]\n\n[[Antiplatelets]]\n\n[[Fibrinolytics]]\n\n[[Phosphodiesterase inhibitors]]\n\n[[Eicosanoid modulators]]\n\n[[Mucolytics]]\n\n[[Expectorants]]\n\n[[Antitussives]]\n\n[[Growth factors]]\n\n[[Laxatives]]\n\n[[Cathartics]]\n\n[[Antispasmodics]]\n\n[[Gastrointestinal motility modulators]]\n\n[[Lipid-lowering agents]]\n\n[[Contraceptives]]\n\n[[Antacids]]\n\n[[Antihistamines]]\n\n[[Antiemetics]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/300-Laboratory-Index":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/400-Metabolic-Pathways-Index":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/500-Microorganisms-Index":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/600-Vitamines-Index":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Antibiotics":{"title":"","content":"#Antibiotics\n\n[[Cell wall inhibitors]]\n\n[[Protein synthesis inhibitors]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Antidepressants":{"title":"","content":"#Antidepressants \n\n[[Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]]\n[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]]\n[[Tricyclic antidepressants]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Autonomic-modulators":{"title":"","content":"#Autonomic-modulators\n\n[[Cholinergic antagonists]]\n[[Cholinergic agonists]]\n[[α-adrenergic agonists]]\n[[α-adrenergic antagonists]]\n[[β-adrenergic agonists]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Bacterioides-fragilis":{"title":"","content":"resistant to penicillin due to broad spectrum cephalosporinase, as well as in prevotella melaninogenicus.","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Bethanechol":{"title":"","content":"#Autonomic-modulators #Cholinergic-agonists #Muscarinic-agonists\n\n## Mechanism of action\n\nIt acts on M3 receptors, causing contraction of the detrusor muscle.\n\n## Therapeutic indications\n\n##### [[Daytime urinary incontinence]]\n\n\n## Sources\n\nAmboss","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Cell-wall-inhibitors":{"title":"","content":"#Antibiotics #Cell-wall-inhibitors\n\n[[β-lactam antibiotics]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-13T07:06:39.37009583Z","tags":null},"/Cephalosporins":{"title":"","content":"They act on [[Streptococci]], but resistant [[Viridans Streptococci]] and [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]] are emerging, specially in pediatric patients; most commonly, they are also resistant to third-generation [[Cephalosporins]].

The most prevalent subtypes in children are urge incontinence and voiding postponement. Stress incontinence is common in adults. The comorbidity of psychological symptoms and disorders is higher, compared to children with enuresis.\n\nFemale patients, specially pregnant women, women who experienced childbirth, and women active in sports, suffer more from stress and mixed incontinence, while males suffer from urge incontinence.\n\n## Etiology\n\nPsychosocial factors, such as stressors (moving from house, sexual abuse, conflicts in the family), and genetic factors play a major role. It can also be caused due to barriers to toileting. It is associated with [[Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], [[Oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[Conduct disorders]].\n\nRisk factors include [[Obesity]], hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, parity, [[Pneumology |pulmonary diseases]], [[Diabetes]], [[Dementia]] and advanced age.\n\nCommon conditions associated with incontinence are neurological causes ([[Multiple sclerosis]], spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, [[Dementia]] and delirium) and genitourinary causes (pelvic floor trauma like surgery, childbirth, fracture, heavy labor, sphincter deficiency, urethral hypermobility, obstruction, pelvic floor weakness, fistula and impaired detrusor contractility). Transient causes include drugs, infections, [[Postmenopausal atrophic urethritis]], [[Psychiatry|psychiatric causes]] (depression, delirium), excessive urinary output (hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia), impaction and impaired mobility.\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nUrge incontinence (bladder dysfunction) is preceded by a sense of urinary urgency due to detrusor overactivity during the filling phase, poor compliance of the detrusor or bladder hypersensitivity. Detrusor overactivity may be caused by bladder irritation (loss of microbiome, abnormalities) or loss of neurologic control (S2-S4 spinal cord injuries, [[Multiple sclerosis]], [[Diabetes]], above brainstem injuries, [[Stroke]], [[Parkinson disease]]). Poor detrusor compliance results in failure of the bladder to stretch, and may be caused by catheterization and pelvic radiotherapy. Inflammation of the urothelium and infection (cancer, renal stones) can lead to alteration of sensation and bladder hypersensitivity. It is also called overactive bladder syndrome, but this last one may not have incontinence.\n\nVoiding postponement can be due to an acquired habit of [[Oppositional defiant disorder]] patients.\n\nNeurogenic bladder can manifest as detrusor overactivity (spastic) and detrusor underactivity (flaccid). Spastic neurogenic bladder can manifest as detrusor sphincter dyssynergia or dysfunctional voiding, where the detrusor contracts and the urethral sphincter is activated instead of relaxed in the emptying phase, blocking most of the urine outlet.\n\nStress incontinence (urethral dysfunction) occurs with increases in intraabdominal pressure, like exertion, effort, sneezing, laughing or coughing due urethral hypermobility or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Urethral hypermobility (inability to close) is caused by pelvic floor weakness (postmenopausal estrogen loss, [[Rheumathology |connective tissue disorders]], childbirth that damages levator ani or S2-S4 nerve roots) or loss of the normal urethrovesical angle. Sphincter deficiency causes sphincter weakness due to aging, [[Obesity]], neurologic dysfunction, pelvic trauma or prostate surgery. \n\nOverflow urinary incontinence includes detrusor underactivity and bladder obstruction. Underactivity of the detrusor can be caused by [[Cholinergic antagonists]], S2-S4 spinal cord injuries, [[Multiple sclerosis]] and [[Diabetes |diabetic neuropathy]]. Bladder obstruction can be caused by [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]]. These mechanisms lead to incomplete bladder emptying and bladder overfilling, distending the bladder and increasing its pressure, causing dribbling when the intravesical pressure increases.\n\nTotal incontinence results from complete loss of sphincter function due to surgery, nerve damage, malignancies o abnormal anatomy (fistulas).\n\n## Clinical features\n\n- Urge incontinence (overactive bladder)\n\t- Sudden urge symptoms\n\t- Increased micturition frequency (\u003e7 times a day) with short intervals in between\n\t- Small voided volumes, especially during the afternoon\n\t- Wetting increased with tiredness\n\t- Urinary tenesmus\n\t- Holding maneuvers to avoid wetting\n\t\t- Contracting pelvic floor muscles\n\t\t- Pressing the thighs together\n\t\t- Holding the abdomen\n\t\t- Jumping from one leg to another\n\t\t- Sitting on the heels\n\t\t- Curtsey sign\n- Voiding postponement\n\t- Decreased micturition frequency (\u003c5 times a day)\n\t- Postponement of micturition in specific situations\n\t- Holding maneuvers to avoid wetting\n\t\t- Contracting pelvic floor muscles\n\t\t- Pressing the thighs together\n\t\t- Holding the abdomen\n\t\t- Jumping from one leg to another\n\t\t- Sitting on the heels\n\t\t- Curtsey sign\n- Dysfunctional voiding (neurogenic bladder)\n\t- Interrupted urine stream without an urge to urinate\n\t- Straining to initiate and maintain micturition\n\t- Incomplete emptying\n\t- Small voided volumes\n- Stress incontinence\n\t- Wetting during coughing or sneezing\n\t- Small voided volumes with no urge to urinate\n- Giggle incontinence\n\t- Wetting during laughing\n\t- Complete emptying\n- Overflow incontinence\n\t- Interrupted stream without an urge to urinate\n\t- Straining to initiate micturition\n\t- Incomplete emptying\n\t- Dribbling when bladder is full\n\t- Dribbling with changes in position\n- Vaginal reflux\n\t- Wetting 10 minutes after normal micturition\n- Total incontinence\n\t- Leakage occurs at all times\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n#### Assessment \n\n1.
